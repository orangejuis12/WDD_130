      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I want to showcase projects on this site, whether it's art, music, or programming related, I'd like for it to be in the same place. This will also make it easier to show to potential employers in the future, as well as help me keep track of projects in an organized way.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience is whoever would like to see my projects! This is not a blog of any kind, but more of a digital journal/portfolio. </p>  <!-- change this -->

        Site tour: 
        Welcome to my site! This is a portfolio/journal site where I can add projects to show potential employers or anyone who wants to see them, and so I can keep track of them!
        You can visit the Art Gallery and the Coding Gallery and see my projects in their respective pages! 

        My Home Page is where I'll make updates on projects, ideas, etc. For now it will just be updated with my current major and all that relevant stuff. 
        That will be updated by the end of the semester since I'm changing my major to something music related, but for now it's still Cybersecurity! Fun stuff. 
        It's not a blog. But it's kind of similar. A school related blog.  

        If you want to look at some of my art projects from the Fall 2025 semester, please visit the Art Gallery!
        If you would like to look at the other sites I've made for this class, please visit the Coding page! 


        Since I want to have this site as a sort of portfolio blog-esque type thing, there's a lot I could add to it.
        Adding links to other sites I've made is one idea. I think there's a way to add python projects on github as a repository, so I'd probably
        add a link to those as well, more for myself since they aren't super crazy projects or anything lol. Just a place to keep them so other people can see them if they want.
        I want to make sure any content I have on the site is well organized, so I'll make sure to label everything correctly and hopefully organize it in some way
        so it's easy to find. I'm learning a lot about databases so it might help to incorporate that somehow, except probably not during this class. That's quite
        a bit above my skill level right now.
        For the first child page, I think I'd like to have that be my art page. I'm not quite sure how I want to organize that yet, but I know I want it to be some
        type of gallery, one that lets you click on the artwork and see it in fullscreen, maybe be able to go through the images with arrow navigation or something like that.
        That's something I might not be able to implement just yet, but it'd be cool for future changes to the site.
        For the second page, I want to have my programming projects and computer science related stuff, all that jazz. Like I was saying I'm not entirely sure how I want to organize that yet,
        but I'll figure it out eventually.
        For the Home page I'll include all the necessary navigation links,some kind of introduction to the content,
        and of course the site purpose paragraph and all of that. It needs to look cute and personalized too.
