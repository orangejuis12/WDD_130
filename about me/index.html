        Hi everyone! I'm from the Midwest, and I'm majoring in cybersecurity! I love to draw, listen to music, play videogames, and read!

        I'm really excited about this class because making websites has always sounded really fun, so hopefully I'll learn a ton about that in this class! :D I'm especially excited about the CSS elements, since it's fun to make stuff look cool!
