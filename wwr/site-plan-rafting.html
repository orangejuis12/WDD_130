    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>My purpose for this website is to learn how to create websites that benefit the buisness or party who uses it, as well as to use this website to learn html and how to build my own websites in the future. For the actual website contents, this website should have meaningful information about the white water rafting company, directory information, schedules, services, etc. Ways for people to get information they need about the company. </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Target audience for white water rafting is likely families who like outdoor activities, probably middle class with a few kids, who like to get out and do activities with their family. They likely want to rent rafts for a day or two, for a vacation or weekend getaway. I think these kinds of sites are usually accessed on computers by these families, it's easier to show more people and is often laid out better in my experience. I would assume they just want a site that can easily allow them to make reservations, and access customer service if needed. Easy use is one thing I often look for on these kinds of sites.</p>

    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
